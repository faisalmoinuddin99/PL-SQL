****** Numeric Data Type ******

# Numeric data type represents numbers, integers and floating-point numbers.

# This type of data is stored as NUMBER (sql type) and PLS_INTEGER (specific to PL/SQL).

# PLS_INTEGER is faster than NUMBER because it uses hardware arithmetic

# PLS_INteGER data type is more space-optimised.
